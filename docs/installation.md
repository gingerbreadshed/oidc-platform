# Installation

Each release of the Synapse OIDC Platform is built as a docker public docker image on [Docker Hub] (https://hub.docker.com/r/synapsestudios/oidc-platform/). The docker image is the recommended way to deploy the OIDC Platform for both development and production purposes. If it is necessary to run the identity platform without docker then you will have to checkout the code from this repo and run the node server on your own boxes.
